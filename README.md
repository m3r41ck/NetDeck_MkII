# Custom Macropad Project

## Project Overview
This is a custom macropad I designed, assembled, and programmed as a personal project to strengthen my hardware and embedded systems skills.

## Features
- PCB design (created using KiCad)
- Firmware flashing QMK
- Hardware assembly and soldering

## Current Status
âœ… Moved from breadboard to custom PCB.  
ðŸ”œ Designing custom enclosure and expanding firmware functionality.

## Lessons Learned
- Double-check PCB traces before ordering!
- How to debug hardware connections
- How to flash and customize firmware

## Next Steps
- Design and 3D-print an enclosure
- Add support for additional macros and features
